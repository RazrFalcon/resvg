    <title>Simple case</title>
    <desc>
        The `feDisplacementMap` support across all tested applications is so bad,
        that it's basically non-existent.
        I can't even create a test to show it. This is how bad it is.
        Every application produces such different results that I can't
        figure out how it actually should work.
