# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This changelog also contains important changes in dependencies.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support [`transform-origin`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#transform-origin-property)
  property.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- Support non-default markers order via
  [`paint-order`](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/painting.html#PaintOrder).
  Previously, only fill and stroke could have been swapped.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- `usvg_tree::Text::flattened` that will contain a flattened/outlined text.
- `usvg_tree::Text::bounding_box`. Will be set only after text flattening.
- Optimize `usvg_tree::NodeExt::abs_transform` by storing absolute transforms in the tree
  instead of calculating them each time.

### Changed
- `usvg_tree::Text::positions` was replaced with `usvg_tree::Text::dx` and `usvg_tree::Text::dy`.<br>
  `usvg_tree::CharacterPosition::x` and `usvg_tree::CharacterPosition::y` are gone.
  They were redundant and you should use `usvg_tree::TextChunk::x`
  and `usvg_tree::TextChunk::y` instead.
- `usvg_tree::LinearGradient::id` and `usvg_tree::RadialGradient::id` are moved to
  `usvg_tree::BaseGradient::id`.
- Do not generate element IDs during parsing. Previously, some elements like `clipPath`s
  and `filter`s could have generated IDs, but it wasn't very reliable and mostly unnecessary.
  Renderer doesn't rely on them and usvg writer would generate them anyway.
- Text-to-paths conversion via `usvg_text_layout::Tree::convert_text` no longer replaces
  original text elements with paths, but instead puts them into `usvg_tree::Text::flattened`.

### Removed
- The `transform` field from `usvg_tree::Path`, `usvg_tree::Image` and `usvg_tree::Text`.
  Only `usvg_tree::Group` can have it.<br>
  It doesn't break anything, because those properties were never used before anyway.<br>
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- `usvg_tree::CharacterPosition`
- `usvg_tree::Path::text_bbox`. Use `usvg_tree::Text::bounding_box` instead.
- `usvg_text_layout::TextToPath` trait for `Text` nodes.
  Only the whole tree can be converted at once.

### Fixed
- Path object bounding box calculation. We were using point bounds instead of tight contour bounds.
  Was broken since v0.34
- Convert text-to-paths in embedded SVGs as well. The one inside the `Image` node.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- Indirect `text-decoration` resolving in some cases.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- (usvg) Clip paths writing to SVG.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).

## [0.36.0] - 2023-10-01
### Added
- `stroke-linejoin=miter-clip` support. SVG2.
  Thanks to [@torokati44](https://github.com/torokati44).
- Quoted FuncIRI support. Like `fill="url('#gradient')"`. SVG2.
  Thanks to [@romanzes](https://github.com/romanzes).
- Allow float values in `rgb()` and `rgba()` colors. SVG2.
  Thanks to [@yisibl](https://github.com/yisibl).
- `auto-start-reverse` variant support to `orient` in markers. SVG2.
  Thanks to [@EpicEricEE](https://github.com/EpicEricEE).

### Changed
- Update dependencies.

### Fixed
- Increase precision of the zero-scale transform check.
  Was rejecting some valid transforms before.
- Panic when rendering a very specific text.
- Greatly improve parsing performance when an SVG has a lot of references.
  Thanks to [@wez](https://github.com/wez).
- (Qt API) Fix scaling factor calculation.
  Thanks to [@missdeer](https://github.com/missdeer).

## [0.35.0] - 2023-06-27
### Fixed
- Panic when an element is completely outside the viewbox.

### Removed
- `FillPaint` and `StrokePaint` filter inputs support.
  It's a mostly undocumented SVG feature that no one supports and no one uses.
  And it was adding a significant complexity to the codebase.
- `usvg::filter::Filter::fill_paint` and `usvg::filter::Filter::stroke_paint`.
- `BackgroundImage`, `BackgroundAlpha`, `FillPaint` and `StrokePaint` from `usvg::filter::Input`.
- `usvg::Group::filter_fill_paint` and `usvg::Group::filter_stroke_paint`.

## [0.34.1] - 2023-05-28
### Fixed
- Transform components order. Affects only `usvg` SVG output and C API.

## [0.34.0] - 2023-05-27
### Changed
- `usvg` uses `tiny-skia` geometry primitives now, including the `Path` container.<br>
  The main difference compared to the old `usvg` primitives
  is that `tiny-skia` uses `f32` instead of `f64`.
  So while in theory we could loose some precision, in practice, `f32` is used mainly
  as a storage type and precise math operations are still done using `f64`.<br>
  `tiny-skia` primitives are move robust, strict and have a nicer API.<br>
  More importantly, this change reduces the peak memory usages for SVGs with large paths
  (in terms of the number of segments).
  And removes the need to convert `usvg::PathData` into `tiny-skia::Path` before rendering.
  Which was just a useless reallocation.
- All numbers are stored as `f32` instead of `f64` now.
- Because we use `tiny-skia::Path` now, we allow _quadratic curves_ as well.
  This includes `usvg` CLI output.
- Because we allow _quadratic curves_ now, text might render slightly differently (better?).
  This is because TrueType fonts contain only _quadratic curves_
  and we were converting them to cubic before.
- `usvg::Path` no longer implements `Default`. Use `usvg::Path::new` instead.
- Replace `usvg::Rect` with `tiny_skia::NonZeroRect`.
- Replace `usvg::PathBbox` with `tiny_skia::Rect`.
- Unlike the old `usvg::PathBbox`, `tiny_skia::Rect` allows both width and height to be zero.
  This is not an error.
- `usvg::filter::Turbulence::base_frequency` was split into `base_frequency_x` and `base_frequency_y`.
- `usvg::NodeExt::calculate_bbox` no longer includes stroke bbox.
- (c-api) Use `float` instead of `double` everywhere.
- The `svgfilters` crate was merged into `resvg`.
- The `rosvgtree` crate was merged into `usvg-parser`.
- `usvg::Group::filter_fill` moved to `usvg::filter::Filter::fill_paint`.
- `usvg::Group::filter_stroke` moved to `usvg::filter::Filter::stroke_paint`.

### Remove
- `usvg::Point`. Use `tiny_skia::Point` instead.
- `usvg::FuzzyEq`. Use `usvg::ApproxEqUlps` instead.
- `usvg::FuzzyZero`. Use `usvg::ApproxZeroUlps` instead.
- (c-api) `resvg_path_bbox`. Use `resvg_rect` instead.
- `svgfilters` crate.
- `rosvgtree` crate.

### Fixed
- Write `transform` on `clipPath` children in `usvg` SVG output.
- Do not duplicate marker children IDs.
  Previously, each element resolved for a marker would preserve its ID.
  Affects only `usvg` SVG output and doesn't affect rendering.

## [0.33.0] - 2023-05-17
### Added
- A new rendering algorithm.<br>
  When rendering [isolated groups](https://razrfalcon.github.io/notes-on-svg-parsing/isolated-groups.html),
  aka layers, we have to know the layer bounding box beforehand, which is ridiculously hard in SVG.<br>
  Previously, resvg would simply use the canvas size for all the layers.
  Meaning that to render a 10x10px layer on a 1000x1000px canvas, we would have to allocate and then blend
  a 1000x1000px layer, which is just a waste of CPU cycles.<br>
  The new rendering algorithm is able to calculate layer bounding boxes, which dramatically improves
  performance when rendering a lot of tiny layers on a large canvas.<br>
  Moreover, it makes performance more linear with a canvas size increase.<br>
  The [paris-30k.svg](https://github.com/google/forma/blob/681e8bfd348caa61aab47437e7d857764c2ce522/assets/svgs/paris-30k.svg)
  sample from [google/forma](https://github.com/google/forma) is rendered _115 times_ faster on M1 Pro now.
  From ~33760ms down to ~290ms. 5269x3593px canvas.<br>
  If we restrict the canvas to 1000x1000px, which would contain only the actual `paris-30k.svg` content,
  then we're _13 times_ faster. From ~3252ms down to ~253ms.
- `resvg::Tree`, aka a render tree, which is an even simpler version of `usvg::Tree`.
  `usvg::Tree` had to be converted into `resvg::Tree` before rendering now.

### Changed
- Restructure the root directory. All crates are in the `crates` directory now.
- Restructure tests. New directory structure and naming scheme.
- Use `resvg::Tree::render` instead of `resvg::render`.
- resvg's `--export-area-drawing` option uses calculated bounds instead of trimming
  excessive alpha now. It's faster, but can lead to a slightly different output.
- (c-api) Removed `fit_to` argument from `resvg_render`.
- (c-api) Removed `fit_to` argument from `resvg_render_node`.
- `usvg::ScreenSize` moved to `resvg`.
- `usvg::ScreenRect` moved to `resvg`.
- Rename `resvg::ScreenSize` into `resvg::IntSize`.
- Rename `resvg::ScreenRect` into `resvg::IntRect`.

### Removed
- `filter` build feature from `resvg`. Filters are always enabled now.
- `resvg::FitTo`
- `usvg::utils::view_box_to_transform_with_clip`
- `usvg::Size::to_screen_size`. Use `resvg::IntSize::from_usvg` instead.
- `usvg::Rect::to_screen_size`. Use `resvg::IntSize::from_usvg(rect.size())` instead.
- `usvg::Rect::to_screen_rect`. Use `resvg::IntRect::from_usvg` instead.
- (c-api) `resvg_fit_to`
- (c-api) `resvg_fit_to_type`

### Fixed
- Double quotes parsing in `font-family`.

## [0.32.0] - 2023-04-23
### Added
- Clipping and masking is up to 20% faster.
- `mask-type` property support. SVG2
- `usvg_tree::MaskType`
- `usvg_tree::Mask::kind`
- (rosvgtree) New SVG 2 mask attributes.

### Changed
- `BackgroundImage` and `BackgroundAlpha` filter inputs will produce the same output
  as `SourceGraphic` and `SourceAlpha` respectively.

### Removed
- `enable-background` support. This feature was never supported by browsers
  and was deprecated in SVG 2. To my knowledge, only Batik has a good support of it.
  Also, it's a performance nightmare, which caused multiple issues in resvg already.
- `usvg_tree::EnableBackground`
- `usvg_tree::Group::enable_background`
- `usvg_tree::NodeExt::filter_background_start_node`

### Fixed
- Improve rectangular clipping anti-aliasing quality.
- Mask's RGB to Luminance converter was ignoring premultiplied alpha.

## [0.31.1] - 2023-04-22
### Fixed
- Use the latest `tiny-skia` to fix SVGs with large masks rendering.

## [0.31.0] - 2023-04-10
### Added
- `usvg::Tree::paint_servers`
- `usvg::Tree::clip_paths`
- `usvg::Tree::masks`
- `usvg::Tree::filters`
- `usvg::Node::subroots`
- (usvg) `--coordinates-precision` and `--transforms-precision` writing options.
  Thanks to [@flxzt](https://github.com/flxzt).

### Fixed
- `fill-opacity` and `stroke-opacity` resolving.
- Double `transform` when resolving `symbol`.
- `symbol` clipping when its viewbox is the same as the document one.
- (usvg) Deeply nested gradients, patterns, clip paths, masks and filters
  were ignored during SVG writing.
- Missing text in nested clip paths and mask, text decoration patterns, filter inputs and feImage.

## [0.30.0] - 2023-03-25
### Added
- Readd `usvg` CLI tool. Can be installed via cargo as before.

### Changed
- Extract most `usvg` internals into new `usvg-tree` and `usvg-parser` crates.
  `usvg-tree` contains just the SVG tree and all the types.
  `usvg-parser` parsers SVG into `usvg-tree`.
  And `usvg` is just an umbrella crate now.
- To use `usvg::Tree::from*` methods one should import the `usvg::TreeParsing` trait now.
- No need to import `usvg-text-layout` manually anymore. It is part of `usvg` now.
- `rosvgtree` no longer reexports `svgtypes`.
- `rosvgtree::Node::attribute` returns just a string now.
- `rosvgtree::Node::find_attribute` returns just a `rosvgtree::Node` now.
- Rename `usvg::Stretch` into `usvg::FontStretch`.
- Rename `usvg::Style` into `usvg::FontStyle`.
- `usvg::FitTo` moved to `resvg::FitTo`.
- `usvg::IsDefault` trait is private now.

### Removed
- `rosvgtree::FromValue`. Due to Rust's orphan rules this trait is pretty useless.

### Fixed
- Recursive markers detection.
- Skip malformed `transform` attributes without skipping the whole element.
- Clipping path rectangle calculation for nested `svg` elements.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- Panic when applying `text-decoration` on text with only one cluster.
  Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- (Qt API) Image size wasn't initialized. Thanks to [@missdeer](https://github.com/missdeer).
- `resvg` CLI allows files with XML DTD again.
- (svgtypes) Handle implicit MoveTo after ClosePath segments.

## [0.29.0] - 2023-02-04
### Added
- `resvg` CLI loads system fonts only when an input SVG has text nodes now.
  Fonts loading is an IO-heavy operation and by avoiding it we can speed up `resvg` execution.
- `usvg::Group::should_isolate`
- `usvg::Tree::has_text_nodes`

### Changed
- Some `usvg` internals were moved into the new `rosvgtree` crate.
- Dummy groups are no longer removed. Use `usvg::Group::should_isolate` to check
  if a group affects rendering.
- `usvg-text-layout::TreeTextToPath::convert_text` no longer has the `keep_named_groups` argument.
- MSRV bumped to 1.65
- Update dependencies.

### Removed
- `usvg::Options::keep_named_groups`. Dummy groups are no longer removed.
- (c-api) `resvg_options_set_keep_named_groups`
- (Qt API) `ResvgOptions::setKeepNamedGroups`

### Fixed
- Missing `font-family` handling.
- `font-weight` resolving.

## [0.28.0] - 2022-12-03
### Added
- `usvg::Text` and `usvg::NodeKind::Text`.

### Changed
- `usvg` isn't converting text to paths by default now. A caller must call
  `usvg::Tree::convert_text` or `usvg::Text::convert` from `usvg-text-layout` crate on demand.
- `usvg` text layout implementation moved into `usvg-text-layout` crate.
- During SVG size recovery, when no `width`, `height` and `viewBox` attributes have been set,
  text nodes are no longer taken into an account. This is because a text node has no bbox
  before conversion into path(s), which we no longer doing during parsing.
- `usvg` is purely an SVG parser now. It doesn't convert text to paths
  and doesn't write SVG anymore.
- `usvg::filter::ConvolveMatrixData` methods are fields now.

### Removed
- `usvg` CLI binary. No alternatives for now.
- All `usvg` build features.
  - `filter`. Filter elements are always parsed by `usvg` now.
  - `text`. Text elements are always parsed by `usvg` now.
  - `export`. `usvg` cannot write an SVG anymore.
- `usvg::Tree::to_string`. `usvg` cannot write an SVG anymore.
- `usvg::TransformFromBBox` trait. This is just a regular `usvg::Transform` method now.
- `usvg::OptionsRef`. `usvg::Options` is enough from now.
- `usvg::Options::fontdb`. Used only by `usvg-text-layout` now.
- `--dump-svg` from `resvg`.

## [0.27.0] - 2022-11-27
### Added
- `lengthAdjust` and `textLength` attributes support.
- Support automatic `image` size detection.
  `width` and `height` attributes can be omitted or set to `auto` on `image` now. SVG2

### Fixed
- `--query-all` flag in `resvg` CLI.
- Percentage values resolving.

## [0.26.1] - 2022-11-21
### Fixed
- Allow `dominant-baseline` and `alignment-baseline` to be set via CSS.

## [0.26.0] - 2022-11-20
### Added
- Minimal `dominant-baseline` and `alignment-baseline` support.
- `mix-blend-mode` and `isolation` support. SVG2
- Allow writing resvg output to stdout.
- Allow disabling text kerning using `kerning="0"` and `style="font-kerning:none"`. SVG2
- Allow `<percentage>` values for `opacity`, `fill-opacity`, `stroke-opacity`,
  `flood-opacity` and `stop-opacity` attributes.<br>
  You can write `opacity="50%"` now. SVG2

### Changed
- Disable focal point correction on radial gradients to conform with SVG 2. SVG2
- Update `feMorphology` radius value resolving.

### Fixed
- Do not clip nested `svg` when only the `viewBox` attribute is present.

## [0.25.0] - 2022-10-30
### Added
- Partial `paint-order` attribute support.
  Markers can only be under or above the shape.

### Fixed
- Compilation issues caused by `rustybuzz` update.

## [0.24.0] - 2022-10-22
### Added
- CSS3 `writing-mode` variants `vertical-rl` and `vertical-lr`.
  Thanks to [yisibl](https://github.com/yisibl).
- (tiny-skia) AArch64 Neon SIMD support. Up to 3x faster on Apple M1.

### Changed
- `usvg::Tree` stores only `Group`, `Path` and `Image` nodes now.
  Instead of emulating an SVG file structure, where gradients, patterns, filters, clips and masks
  are part of the nodes tree (usually inside the `defs` element), we reference them using `Rc`
  from now.
  This change makes `usvg` a bit simpler. Makes `usvg` API way easier, since instead of
  looking for a node via `usvg::Tree::defs_by_id` the caller can access the type directly via `Rc`.
  And makes creation of custom `usvg::Tree`s way easier.
- `clip_path`, `mask` and `filters` `usvg::Group` fields store `Rc` instead of `String` now.
- `usvg::NodeExt::units` was moved to `usvg::Paint::units`.
- `usvg::filter::ImageKind::Use` stores `usvg::Node` instead of `String`.
- `usvg::PathData` stores commands and points separately now to reduce overall memory usage.
- `usvg::PathData` segments should be accessed via `segments()` now.
- Most numeric types have been moved to the `strict-num` crate.
- Rename `NormalizedValue` into `NormalizedF64`.
- Rename `PositiveNumber` into `PositiveF64`.
- Raw number of numeric types should be accessed via `get()` method instead of `value()` now.
- `usvg::TextSpan::font_size` is `NonZeroPositiveF64` instead of `f64` now.
- Re-export `usvg` and `tiny-skia` dependencies in `resvg`.
- Re-export `roxmltree` dependency in `usvg`.
- (usvg) Output float precision is reduced from 11 to 8 digits.

### Removed
- `usvg::Tree::create`. `usvg::Tree` is an open struct now.
- `usvg::Tree::root`. It's a public field now.
- `usvg::Tree::svg_node`. Replaced with `usvg::Tree` public fields.
- `defs`, `is_in_defs`, `append_to_defs` and `defs_by_id` from `usvg::Tree`.
  We no longer emulate SVG structure. No alternative.
- `usvg::Tree::is_in_defs`. There are no `defs` anymore.
- `usvg::Paint::Link`. We store gradient and patterns directly in `usvg::Paint` now.
- `usvg::Svg`. No longer needed. `size` and `view_box` are `usvg::Tree` fields now.
- `usvg::SubPathIter` and `usvg::PathData::subpaths`. No longer used.

### Fixed
- Path bbox calculation scales stroke width too.
  Thanks to [growler](https://github.com/growler).
- (tiny-skia) Round caps roundness.
- (xmlparser) Stack overflow on specific files.
- (c-api) `resvg_is_image_empty` output was inverted.

## [0.23.0] - 2022-06-11
### Added
- `#RRGGBBAA` and `#RGBA` color notation support.
  Thanks to [demurgos](https://github.com/demurgos).

### Fixed
- Panic during recursive `pattern` resolving.
  Thanks to [FylmTM](https://github.com/FylmTM).
- Spurious warning when using `--export-id`.
  Thanks to [benoit-pierre](https://github.com/benoit-pierre).

## [0.22.0] - 2022-02-20
### Added
- Support `svg` referenced by `use`. External SVG files are still not supported.

### Changed
- `ttf-parser`, `fontdb` and `rustybuzz` have been updated.

## [0.21.0] - 2022-02-13
### Added
- `usvg::ImageHrefResolver` that allows a custom `xlink:href` handling.
  Thanks to [antmelnyk](https://github.com/antmelnyk).
- `usvg::Options::image_href_resolver`
- Support for GIF images inside the `<image>` element.
- (fontdb) Support for loading user fonts on Windows.
- (fontdb) Support for parsing fontconfig config files on Linux.
  For now, only to retrieve a list of font dirs.

### Changed
- MSRV bumped to 1.51
- `usvg::ImageKind` stores data as `Arc<Vec<u8>>` and not just `Vec<u8>` now.

### Fixed
- Every nested `svg` element defines a new viewBox now. Previously, we were always using the root one.
- Correctly handle SVG size calculation when SVG doesn't have a size and any elements.
- Improve groups ungrouping speed.

## [0.20.0] - 2021-12-29
### Changed
- `resvg::render` and `resvg::render_node` accept a transform now.
- (c-api) `resvg_render` and `resvg_render_node` accept a transform now.
- `usvg::Color` is a custom type and not a `svgtypes::Color` reexport now.
- `usvg::Color` doesn't contain alpha anymore, which have been added in v0.16
  Alpha would be automatically flattened.
  This makes [Micro SVG](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/docs/usvg_spec.adoc)
  compatible with SVG 1.1 again.
- (c-api) Rename `RESVG_FIT_TO_*` into `RESVG_FIT_TO_TYPE_*`.

### Fixed
- The `--background` argument in `resvg` correctly handles alpha now.
- Fix building usvg without filter feature but with export.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-10-04
### Added
- Better text-on-path converter accuracy by accounting the current transform.

### Changed
- `usvg::NodeExt::abs_transform` includes current node transform now.
- Improved turbulence filter performance. Thanks to [akindle](https://github.com/akindle).
- Multiple dependencies updated.

## [0.18.0] - 2021-09-12
### Added
- `filter` build feature. Enabled by default.
- `usvg::PathBbox` and `resvg_path_bbox` (to C API).

### Changed
- (usvg) All filter related types are under the `filter` module now.
- (usvg) Remove `Fe` prefix from all filter types.
- (c-api) `resvg_get_node_bbox` returns `resvg_path_bbox` now.

### Fixed
- Horizontal and vertical lines processing.
- C API building without the `text` feature.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-09-04
### Added
- `tiny-skia` updated with support of images larger than 8000x8000 pixels.
- `feDropShadow` support. SVG2
- [`<filter-value-list>`](https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/#typedef-filter-value-list) support.
  Meaning that the `filter` attribute can have multiple values now.
  Like `url(#filter1) blur(2)`. SVG2
- All [filter functions](https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/#filter-functions). SVG2
- Support all [new](https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#ltblendmodegt) `feBlend` modes. SVG2
- Automatic SVG size detection when `width`/`height`/`viewBox` is not set.
  Thanks to [reknih](https://github.com/reknih).
- `usvg::Options::default_size`
- `--default-width` and `--default-height` to usvg.

### Changed
- `usvg::Group::filter` is a list of filter IDs now.
- `usvg::FeColorMatrixKind::Saturate` accepts any positive `f64` value now.
- `svgfilters::ColorMatrix::Saturate` accepts any positive `f64` value now.
- Fonts memory mapping was split into a separate build feature: `memmap-fonts`.
  Now you can build resvg/usvg with `system-fonts`, but without `memmap-fonts`.
  Enabled by default.
- The `--dump-svg` argument in resvg CLI tool should be enabled using `--features dump-svg` now.
  No enabled by default.
- `usvg::Tree::to_string` is behind the `export` build feature now.

### Fixed
- When writing SVG, `usvg` will use `rgba()` notations for colors instead of `#RRGGBB`.

## [0.16.0] - 2021-08-22
### Added
- CSS3 colors support. Specifically `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla` and `transparent`. SVG2
- Allow missing `rx`/`ry` attributes on `ellipse`. SVG2

  Previously, only `--width` or `--height` were allowed.
- `usvg::Path::text_bbox`
- The maximum number of SVG elements is limited by 1_000_000 now.
  Mainly to prevent a billion laugh style attacks.
- The maximum SVG elements nesting is limited by 1024 now.
- `usvg::Error::ElementsLimitReached`

  and requires a directory now.
- (qt-api) `ResvgOptions::setFilePath` changed to `ResvgOptions::setResourcesDir`
  and requires a directory now.

### Fixed
- Support multiple values inside a `text-decoration` attribute.

### Removed
- `Image`. Use `tiny_skia::PixmapMut` instead.
- (c-api) `resvg_image` struct and `resvg_image_*` methods. `resvg` renders onto
  the provided buffer now.

## [0.12.0] - 2020-12-05
### Changed
- resvg no longer requires a C++ compiler!
- `tiny-skia` was updated to a pure Rust version, which means that `resvg` no longer
  depends on `clang` and should work on 32bit targets.

## [0.11.0] - 2020-07-04
### Highlights
- All backends except Skia were removed. Skia is the only official one from now.
- New C API implementation.

### Added
- Support for user-defined fonts in usvg, resvg and C API.
- `--serif-family`, `--sans-serif-family`, `--cursive-family`, `--fantasy-family`
  `--monospace-family`, `--use-font-file`, `--use-fonts-dir`, `--skip-system-fonts` and `--list-fonts`
  options to all CLI tools.
- New tests suite. Instead of testing against the previous build, now we're testing against
  prerendered PNG images. Which is way faster.<br>
  And you can test resvg without the internet connection now.<br>
  And all you need is just `cargo test`.

### Changed
- Library uses an embedded Skia by default now.
- Switch `harfbuzz_rs` with `rustybuzz`.
- Rendering doesn't require `usvg::Options` now.
- (usvg) The `fontdb` module moved into its own crate.

  [generic fonts](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-css-fonts-3-20180920/#generic-family-value)
  on Linux. Mainly because it's very slow.
- (usvg) When an `image` element contains a file path, the file will be loaded into memory now,
  instead of simply storing a file path. And will be dumped as base64 on SVG save.
  In case of an SVG image, it will be loaded as a `Tree` and saved as base64 encoded XML on save.
- (usvg) `ImageData` replaced with `ImageKind`.
- (usvg) Fonts database is empty by default now and should be filled manually.
- (c-api) Almost a complete rewrite.

### Removed
- All backends except the Skia one.
- `Options` from all backends. We don't use it anymore.
- (usvg) `ImageFormat`.
- (c-api) Rendering on a backends canvas no longer supported. Was constantly misused.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-06-19

### Changed
- The `resvg` crate has been split into four: resvg-cairo, resvg-qt, resvg-skia and resvg-raqote.<br/>
  So from now, instead of enabling a required backend via cargo features,
  you should select a required backend-specific crate.<br/>
  This allows us to have a better integration with a selected 2D library.<br/>
  And we also have separated C API implementations now.<br/>
  And each backend has its own vendored archive too.
- (qt-backend) Use `QImage` instead of Rust libraries for raster images loading.

### Removed
- The `resvg` crate. Use backend-specific crates.
